# LORA macOS/iOS Communications App

ðŸš§ **Project Status: Active Development** ðŸš§

A native Swift/Rust application rewrite of the original Electron-based meshtastic-macos-client, providing communication with Meshtastic/LoRa devices on macOS and iOS.

> **Note**: This project is currently under active development. Core functionality is working but some features are still being implemented. See the [Development Status](#development-status) section below for current progress.

## Project Overview

This project is a complete rewrite of the JavaScript/Electron meshtastic-macos-client into a native Swift/Rust application architecture. The original project used:
- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript with Electron
- **Backend**: Node.js with direct CLI calls to meshtastic
- **UI Framework**: Electron with web technologies

The new architecture uses:
- **Frontend**: SwiftUI for both macOS and iOS
- **Core Logic**: Rust library with async device communication
- **Bridge**: C FFI for Swift-Rust interoperability
- **Packaging**: Native macOS app bundle and iOS app

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **Swift Layer**: Native macOS/iOS UI using SwiftUI
- **Rust Core**: Low-level device communication and protocol handling
- **FFI Bridge**: C interface between Swift and Rust
- **Shared Models**: Common data structures across platforms

### Key Advantages

- **Performance**: Native code execution vs. JavaScript interpretation
- **Memory Efficiency**: No Chromium engine overhead
- **iOS Support**: Can run natively on iOS devices
- **System Integration**: Better macOS/iOS system integration
- **Security**: No web security concerns

## Features

### âœ… Implemented
- Native macOS application with SwiftUI interface
- Serial/USB device connectivity
- Real-time messaging interface
- Device discovery and management
- Message encryption (AES-256) with macOS Keychain integration
- Redis caching layer for performance optimization
- Mesh network topology visualization
- Cross-platform shared Rust core logic

### ðŸš§ In Development
- Bluetooth device connectivity (BLE + RFCOMM)
- Centralized theming system (IBM Carbon Design inspired)
- Advanced radio settings (SF, BW, TX Power)
- Message delivery acknowledgments and retry logic
- Full Meshtastic protocol compliance

### ðŸ“‹ Planned
- Native iOS application
- TCP/IP device connectivity
- File transfer capabilities
- GPS integration for position messages
- Mesh routing optimization

## Building

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 15+
- Rust 1.70+
- Swift 5.9+

### Build Instructions

1. Build the Rust core library:
   ```bash
   cd Core
   cargo build --release
   ```

2. Open the Xcode workspace and build the macOS/iOS targets.
