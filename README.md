# LORA macOS/iOS Communications App

ðŸš§ **Project Status: Active Development** ðŸš§

A native Swift/Rust application rewrite of the original Electron-based meshtastic-macos-client, providing communication with Meshtastic/LoRa devices on macOS and iOS.

> **Note**: This project is currently under active development. Core functionality is working but some features are still being implemented. See the [Development Status](#development-status) section below for current progress.

## Project Overview

This project is a complete rewrite of the JavaScript/Electron meshtastic-macos-client into a native Swift/Rust application architecture. The original project used:
- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript with Electron
- **Backend**: Node.js with direct CLI calls to meshtastic
- **UI Framework**: Electron with web technologies

The new architecture uses:
- **Frontend**: SwiftUI for both macOS and iOS
- **Core Logic**: Rust library with async device communication
- **Bridge**: C FFI for Swift-Rust interoperability
- **Packaging**: Native macOS app bundle and iOS app

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **Swift Layer**: Native macOS/iOS UI using SwiftUI
- **Rust Core**: Low-level device communication and protocol handling
- **FFI Bridge**: C interface between Swift and Rust
- **Shared Models**: Common data structures across platforms

### Key Advantages

- **Performance**: Native code execution vs. JavaScript interpretation
- **Memory Efficiency**: No Chromium engine overhead
- **iOS Support**: Can run natively on iOS devices
- **System Integration**: Better macOS/iOS system integration
- **Security**: No web security concerns

## Features

### âœ… Implemented
- Native macOS application with SwiftUI interface
- Serial/USB device connectivity
- Real-time messaging interface

  - CarbonSidebar with collapsible navigation and badges
  - CarbonModal for dialogs and confirmations
  - CarbonNotification system with toast notifications
  - CarbonProgressIndicator (linear and circular, determinate and indeterminate)
  - CarbonProgressSteps for multi-step workflows

- **Design System Showcase**
  - Interactive design system documentation and component showcase
  - Live examples of all colors, typography, components, and spacing
  - Accessible via "Design System" in the sidebar

### âœ… Recently Completed
- **Enhanced CoreBluetooth Integration**
  - Comprehensive Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) support for Meshtastic devices
  - Real-time connection progress tracking with visual indicators
  - Signal strength monitoring (RSSI) with quality assessment
  - Automatic device discovery and reconnection capabilities
  - Connection error handling with user-friendly error messages
  - Multi-step connection process visualization
